# Reverse-DCF

This repository provides an interactive reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis to estimate the implied growth rate of a company based on its market capitalization and current stock price.

# ðŸš€ How it works
The program:
1. Takes inputs such as the initial free cash flow (FCF), discount rate, terminal growth rate, number of shares, and current stock price.
2. Performs a reverse DCF analysis to find the implied growth rate that justifies the market capitalization.
3. Calculates the intrinsic value of the company based on the implied growth rate.
4. Provides an analysis of the upside or downside potential for the stock based on the intrinsic value.
